Shruthi Vikram's Interative gallery.

I created my interactive gallery using Javascript, CSS and HTML.
I chose the design beacause I am a fan of cars and wanted to display all top brands of cars.

I found very few challenges like creating the animation for "Gallery"
I tried few different methods and finally using "keyframes" worked

Another challenge I faced was creating the animation for all descriptions
It took me a while to figure out the proper code using for loops.
